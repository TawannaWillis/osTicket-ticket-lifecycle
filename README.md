# osTicket-ticket-lifecycle
A comprehensive walkthrough of the ticket lifecycle within osTicket, covering ticket creation, resolution, escalation, and closure in a help desk environment.






<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

In the osTicket system, users must access the ticket portal and log in if required to submit a support request. Within the portal, they can create a ticket by selecting a relevant Help Topic, providing a brief summary of the issue, and detailing their IT concern as they would in an email. For this project, I generated three example tickets that reflect common technical problems encountered in a real-world support environment. These tickets demonstrate how issues are categorized, documented, and processed within the system to ensure efficient troubleshooting and resolution.

As the admin (jane), she will receive the ticket requests from their panel once they are sent. The admins can then reassign tickets to an agent or appropriate team in this example Jane is a part of the online banking team, therefore the ticket is assisgned to her. The priority level of the issue is determined and assigned accordingly in this example jane changed the severity to Emergency as this is a critical issue.

When resolving tickets, it is important to have strong communication. One has to communicate with their team and the affected users. Tickets come and go with different issues and are assigned appropriately to different people. One of these tickets are assigned to John from Jane and Jane herself was able to manage a ticket by herself. Documentation is crucial to a successful environment. Tickets need to be documented properly so they can be used as reference if a similar issue shows up in the future.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

The protocols for how tickets are managed can differ depending on the work environment. There may be a quota for how many tickets need to be resolved within a certain time frame and certain tickets will have to be prioritized depending on the situation. I have built osTicket from scratch and was able to understand how tickets work in an IT position.
