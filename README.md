In the osTicket system, users must access the ticket portal and log in if required to submit a support request. Within the portal, they can create a ticket by selecting a relevant Help Topic, providing a brief summary of the issue, and detailing their IT concern as they would in an email. For this project, I generated three example tickets that reflect common technical problems encountered in a real-world support environment. (Please note I will only be showing one ticket "online banking is down" in the rest of the lab")  These tickets demonstrate how issues are categorized, documented, and processed within the system to ensure efficient troubleshooting and resolution.

As the admin (jane), she will receive the ticket requests from their panel once they are sent. The admins can then reassign tickets to an agent or appropriate team in this example Jane is a part of the online banking team, therefore the ticket is assisgned to her. The priority level of the issue is determined and assigned accordingly in this example jane changed the severity to Emergency as this is a critical issue. It is important to note in the third slide, the communication about the ticket and its resolution. It is important to have outstanding communication amongst other agents, teams as well as the customer/client. Since Jane was able to manage the ticket by herself Jane did most of the commucation, documenting the problem as well as the resolution.

<p>
It is important to close out the ticket when the ticket has been handles and resolved. This is another form of having great communication amongst your fellow Agents, teams and customers/clients. Here Jane marked the ticket as resolved, and noted that the problem should be resolved within the hour.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>


Working with the osTicket system provided valuable insights into ticket management and resolution in an IT support environment. I learned how users submit tickets by selecting appropriate Help Topics and detailing their issues, ensuring clear documentation for troubleshooting. As an admin, I practiced assigning tickets, prioritizing severity levels, and maintaining effective communication with both clients and team members. This lab reinforced the importance of tracking progress, documenting resolutions, and properly closing tickets to ensure seamless support operations. Strong communication and organization within the ticketing system are key to efficient issue resolution and customer satisfaction.
